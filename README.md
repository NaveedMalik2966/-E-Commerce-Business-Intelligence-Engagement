# E-Commerce-Business-Intelligence-Engagement
End-to-End Marketplace Revenue & Retention Analysis

🧠 Business Context

This project simulates a real-world analytics engagement for a multi-vendor e-commerce marketplace.

Leadership required clarity on:

Revenue performance and growth trajectory

Customer retention strength

Segment-level revenue contribution

Operational impact on customer satisfaction

Product category revenue concentration

Long-term sustainability risks

The objective was to evaluate structural strengths and weaknesses and provide strategic recommendations.

📦 Dataset

Olist Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset
Multi-table relational marketplace data including:

Orders

Order Items

Customers

Products

Reviews

Category Mapping

Time Coverage: ~24 months of transactions

🏗 Analytical Framework

The engagement followed a structured methodology:

Data Validation & Integrity Checks

Revenue Modeling (GMV Construction)

Time-Series Revenue Trend Analysis

Customer Retention & RFM Segmentation

Cohort Retention Modeling

Operational Performance Impact Analysis

Category Revenue & Concentration Assessment

Strategic Business Recommendations

📈 Key Performance Metrics

Total Revenue (GMV): 15.4M

Completed Orders: 96,478

Average Order Value (AOV): 159.83

Repeat Purchase Rate: ~3%

Late Delivery Rate: ~6.8%

🔍 Core Findings
1️⃣ Revenue Growth

Revenue scaled rapidly during 2017 but stabilized in 2018, indicating potential acquisition slowdown or market maturity.

2️⃣ Retention Weakness

~97% of customers are one-time buyers

Cohort analysis shows sharp drop-off after Month 1

Revenue growth is acquisition-driven, not lifecycle-driven

3️⃣ Customer Segmentation

Loyal Customers generate ~31% of total revenue

Champions contribute meaningfully but are not dominant

At Risk customers represent significant revenue exposure

4️⃣ Operational Impact

Late deliveries drastically reduce review scores

~61% of late deliveries result in low ratings

Operational reliability is critical to brand protection

5️⃣ Category Economics

Revenue moderately diversified

Top 5–7 categories generate ~50% of revenue

No extreme concentration risk

🚨 Strategic Risk

The marketplace is heavily dependent on continuous customer acquisition.

With a repeat purchase rate near 3%, long-term revenue sustainability is vulnerable if acquisition slows.

🎯 Strategic Recommendations

Develop structured retention programs

Prioritize lifecycle marketing & cross-sell

Maintain strict operational reliability

Focus growth on high-performing categories

Reduce dependency on new customer acquisition
